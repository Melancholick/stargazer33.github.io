Those are the most common complaints of mid- to senior-level programmers. The fact of the matter is that those are common problems for a reason — they are really hard to solve. (Even harder than reversing a binary tree on a blackboard with chalk.)</div><div><br></div><div>They are also problems Apartment Therapy Media doesn't have.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Reports from a private #slack channel</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Here’s what people who actually work on this team have to say about working here:</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;smart, action-oriented people; everyone always willing to jump in to help; flat team culture&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;working from home is obviously great&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;I feel like our priorities stay pretty solid once they’re defined and on the roadmap; I’ve definitely worked places where they shift so much nobody ever knows what’s going on - definitely a bad thing about other places&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;diverse team is really cool too - everyone comes from a very interesting background&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;coming into this team I was used to using what was easy. seems like the whole team here jumps on board with what makes the most and best sense.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;we’ve also hired people who have a 'bias for action.' Like get your hands dirty from day 1 and shine.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Imagine for a moment, it’s easy if you try...</strong></div><div><br></div><div>You wake up in the morning.</div><div><br></div><div>Your commute is 45 seconds.</div><div><br></div><div>You wear what you like.</div><div><br></div><div>You pick up a coffee on the way and it's just the way you like it (from your own kitchen).</div><div><br></div><div>You settle into your desk that has awesome natural light (or is a lightless cave, whichever you prefer).</div><div><br></div><div>You hop on #slack and say what you're going to get done&nbsp;&nbsp;(meaning today), your coworkers&nbsp;&nbsp;.</div><div><br></div><div>Your code written yesterday has been reviewed&nbsp;. You merge into master and the code is automagically tested and pushed to production. Review some of the code your coworkers wrote, asking questions and making suggestions.</div><div><br></div><div>You move on to Asana. Mark the task related to the code you just pushed as &quot;Done&quot; and pick up the next task with your name on it. You get started coding on this next task with no surprises.</div><div><br></div><div>You might find yourself bouncing ideas off your coworkers about the best way to modularize a piece of functionality you're working on and the benefits of including vs. delegating.</div><div><br></div><div>If it's a Monday or Friday there might be a meeting on Google Hangouts or Zoom (the meetings on Fridays often include the discussion of and consumption of adult beverages).</div><div><br></div><div>You stop working about 8 hours after you started, go on with your life, and sleep soundly while the application keeps humming and serving 10s of millions of uniques a month.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Sound too good to be true?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Let's run down the numbers. In the last 12 months, one person has left the team (for a really awesome job at a company you’ve heard of). Zero people have been terminated from the team. The current team has 3 Front End Engineers (Maine, South Carolina, Missouri) and 3 Back End Engineers (California, Utah, New Mexico), 2 Designers (New York and Missouri), and 2 Product Managers (Pennsylvania and Wyoming).</div><div><br></div><div>And if you do run into a problem that the team can't solve, email the CEO, call the CFO, or DM the whole editorial staff on #slack. I can guarantee they would all love to hear from anybody on the team.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Punch above your weight class.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>How do you serve those 10s of millions of uniques a month with only 6 full-time engineers? Very carefully. No heros. Doing what you know to be best (not easiest).</div><div><br></div><div>Then push what you know. Ask questions. Try things. Own everything.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you want to win shouting arguments? Or do you want to have great coworkers, a stable application, and go home on time?</div><div><br></div><div>Even if you aren't a great fit and you don't apply, I want to personally assure you that these things are possible … and we're profitable to boot.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The opening</strong></div><div><br></div><div>This is a growth opening, meaning a new position that didn't exist before.

This position could go a few different ways: We have a realistic budget for this position when compared against the national average provided by payscale.com (especially given the location independence). We’ve decided not to limit ourselves to a particular level of applicant (junior, senior, et al) until we actually see applicants. Therefore, if you think our culture sounds like a good fit for you, apply regardless of your current level.</div><div><br></div><div>This position reports to the Lead Backend Engineer. That said, we have a very flat organizational structure.

The company will pay for 50% of the single election of each plan. If you are located in a state that does not accept our main coverage then we are able to offer insurance through a provider who is commonly used in that state. This benefit is eligible to all employees on their 31st day of employment.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Dental/Vision Benefits:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We currently offer a combined Dental/Vision plan that employees are eligible to purchase on the 1st of the month after 30 days of employment. This plan is through United Healthcare.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Ancillary Benefits:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The company provides Life Insurance for all employees 1x their annual salary up to $50,000. Employees are able to purchase additional Life Insurance if they would like.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>401k/Profit Sharing Plan:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>After 1 year of service all employees are eligible to sign up for the company 401k plan through Vanguard. At the end of the year the company will decide if they'd like to do a Profit Share (based on company's performance that year) and if we decide to do the Profit Share then we put 3% of the employee's total compensation into their 401k once they are eligible for the plan.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Paid Time Off:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Employees start with 17 paid days off per year in addition to company holidays.</div><div><br></div><div>We also have some fun corporate wellness initiatives.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>A few more words on logistics</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Our Stack and Process :&nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://github.com/apartmenttherapy/meta&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://github.com/apartmenttherapy/meta</a></div><div><br></div><div>We are doing blind hiring for this position up until the final round where the applicant meets the whole team on zoom.

We believe that a passionate and talented developer can learn new practices and technologies. Similarly, we don't place a lot of importance on educational background - as a developer your experience, portfolio, and abilities are key, not your grades :). We do need to see some experience of working in web development and creating or contributing to web applications.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>LESS</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>CoffeeScript</li><li>Knockout.js</li><li>Gulp</li><li>Git</li><li>Require.js</li><li>Bower</li><li>Go</li><li>ColdFusion</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Redis</li><li>Vagrant/Docker</li></ul><p>Our entire team works daily with HTML, CSS/LESS, JavaScript (particularly Knockout.js),RESTful APIs, and integrations, and so, experience in full stack web development is important. However, if you are particularly skilled in front-end developent or you are a highly experienced back-end developer, we'd love to hear from you.</p><p><strong>More Info</strong></p><p>Teamwork Projects is our flagship product and is used by many of the world's biggest companies, with over 370,000 installations, two million daily users and more than three million unique projects. Despite the vast array of features available in Teamwork Projects, it has been built entirely by a small team of talented developers. We pride ourselves on giving our users what they need and are constantly working on new features and improvements for our customers.</p><p>By joining our team, you can be assured not only that your work will be seen and enjoyed by millions of users worldwide, but that you will learn and grow continuously, in a friendly, open environment.</p><p><em>We care about all our teams, and they care about when their teammates will be online, what their timezone is and where they will be working from. When you apply we will ask you about where you intend to work from. We will also ask you whether or not you are open to considering spending some time in our Irish office, if you would like to work remotely, if you would like to relocate or if you're already here and ready to start work at Teamwork HQ in Cork, Ireland.</em></p>            </div>        </div>            <h2>                Skills &amp; Requirements            </h2>            <div><p><strong>Must Have:</strong></p><p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Much of your work is front-end focused and customer-facing, so it's important that you are confident in your abilities and able to contribute to new and existing features. While we work in&nbsp;<em>Knockout.js</em>, it isn't pivotal that you are experienced in any particular framework, although knowledge of any popular&nbsp;<em>MV*</em> framework is hugely beneficial.</p><p><strong>Coding best practices</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>We work closely as a team on many features, so writing clean and extensible code is a must. Your code should be easy to debug, while you code, you consider the impact your work has on other developers, the product in general, and our testing department.</p><p><strong>RESTful API experience:</strong> We currently have an extensive API, which is constantly evolving and growing. Therefore, experience in designing and/or integrating with APIs is extremely important to us. Our application is data-driven, so you should be aware of how to work with large collections of data while maintaining a great user experience.</p><p><strong>The right attitude:</strong> We want you to take as much pride in your work as we do and strive to find the right solutions for our customers. The right applicant should be able to think on his or her feet and adapt to new technologies.</p><p><strong>Help us grow and improve:&nbsp;</strong>At Teamwork.com, we are always open to new ideas and, more importantly, open to change. We are aware that new technologies and approaches will come along that need to be embraced. As a Teamwork.com Developer, your voice rings loud and, if you know of ways that we can improve, we want to hear your ideas.</p><p><strong>Nice to Have:</strong></p><p><strong>CoffeeScript</strong></p><p><strong>Build tools:&nbsp;</strong>Gulp, Grunt, Lineman.js, etc.</p><p><strong>Front-end testing</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Go/ColdFusion:&nbsp;</strong>Our API is written in <em>Go</em>&nbsp;and <em>ColdFusion</em>. As we build new features, we often need to update our API. Having experience in either <em>Go</em>&nbsp;or <em>ColdFusion</em> would help you hit the ground running.</p><p><strong>Responsive/Adaptive applications:</strong> Having experience in building responsive or adaptive web applications is a big plus.</p><p><strong>Samples of your work:&nbsp;</strong>Do you contribute to open source communities?

It’s great stack to work with everyday, and we take our time to write solid code and proper tests to make sure it stays that way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dev Process</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>We do a fair amount of pair programming and a lot of code reviews, we love solid tests and continuous integration, and we deploy several times a week. Basically? We’re constantly improving our process so we can create an ideal developer environment - low overheads, high transparency. Estimates were inaccurate and irrelevant, so we dropped ‘em. Artificial deadlines weren’t doing it for us, so we switched from scrum to pure kanban and never looked back. When something isn’t working, we’re not afraid to throw it out and try something new - so if you have exciting ideas about the dev process and how to make your own job even better, you’ll fit right in. (We’re open-minded like that.)&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll have final responsibility for the solutions you build, from inception all the way through to deployment, so your teammates know exactly who to shower with praise when you ship to production.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong> &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>You've got real life (professional or open source) experience with Elixir or Erlang&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You have a fair amount of experience as part of a software team, contributing to building a production app&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Live anywhere in N. America (need to be able to provide documentation of eligibility to work in the USA)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You know how to communicate effectively and work as part of a team with lots of different backgrounds and roles&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Passionate about improving the development process and recognise the value of an awesome company culture</p><ul><li>Not a jerk</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>About Us</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>We’re a small team of about 30 people, all working remotely across the US &amp; Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual meetup week where we work together on cool projects all day and generally make fools of ourselves all night. We’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people yourself. We like those people.)&nbsp;</p><p>We know we’re ridiculously lucky to have this crack squad of ambitious, kind, independent little nerds, and we want to keep that going by bringing in even more people who love geeking out about what they do and doing work they’ll be super proud of. (And on that note, we’re an equal-opportunity employer genuinely committed to building a diverse team, and to fostering the type of inclusive environment in which diversity thrives.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Perks &amp; Benefits</strong> &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Work from home (or wherever there’s strong wifi)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>4 weeks paid vacation (Shazam! And yes, everyone actually uses all 4 weeks)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Monthly cleaning service for your home&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>not that we don't have total faith in you&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Paid home Internet service&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Coworking space/coffee shop working expenses&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Health, dental, and vision coverage for you and your fam&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>401(k) plan with employer match&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Up to two months family leave for new parents (including adoption)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>An extra paid day off per quarter so you can volunteer in your community (awww)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>New Mac laptop (#blessed)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Books, conferences, and other educational resources to help you be even more amazing at what you do!&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>TSA pre-check to make getting to retreats and conferences a breeze&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Check ‘em out in even more detail here (you know you’re curious):https://docs.google.com/document/d/1txOs5h-ZjbOqMW-GxmJcKnCClKK3yVqOWO0hhHBAbT0/edit </p></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></body></html>",

Great! Now code it and ship it, all in the same day.</p><p>The Mission</p><p>viagogo is on a mission to revolutionise the way people get tickets to live events, making it possible for anyone, anywhere in the world to see their favourite artists, teams or shows live. We’ve helped over 15 million people from over 150 countries attend live events, and we’re just getting started. We believe creative individuals with innovative ideas are the engine for our rapid growth, so we’re looking for the world’s smartest front-end developers and UX designers to join our Front-End Team, where you’ll be given the freedom to make meaningful and measurable improvements impacting millions of people.</p><p>Your Role</p><p>Your role is simple – think of ways to improve our user experience and get these improvements into the hands of our users as quickly as possible. Have a feature in mind? Great! Now code it and ship it, all in the same day. We deploy fast and often, and you’ll be given full autonomy to test your own ideas with direct access to data on how your changes impact our millions of users around the world. You will not be a user researcher, a designer, a developer, a copywriter or an analyst; you will be the best of all of them, because if you have a great idea, we believe you are best suited to own it from start to finish. So you won’t be assigned your work; you’re going to be the one creating it.</p><p>Of course you won’t be alone. You’ll be part of a small, focused and agile team of talented developers and designers just like yourself, because we believe collaboration is essential. You should thrive on the feedback and critique from your teammates and not be shy to give it in return. You should come prepared to learn new skills from veterans of the front-end and share your own unique skillset with others.</p><p>Your Skills</p><p>You get things done. You can swiftly turn an idea into a reality. That means you’re comfortable with <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. If you have no experience, you’re eager to learn. Familiarity with JS and/or C# is a plus, but not necessary. Shipping features fast is not an excuse for sloppy code – quick and clean, not quick and dirty.</p><p>You break the rules. You know that every product is unique and UX “best practices” can hinder innovation or fall apart when users span over 150 countries and 30 languages. You know the best ideas don’t always come from books or blogs; they come from putting yourself in our users’ shoes and taking inspiration wherever you can find it.</p><p>You thrive on feedback. You don’t just come up with great ideas, you test them, and you respect that data that comes back from our users. Sometimes they will respond positively to your change and sometimes they won’t, but you won’t be discouraged. You’ll use the wealth of data available at your fingertips to understand user behaviour and find the next best idea.</p><p>You are a team player. You work not just to advance your own skills or ideas, but also to help the team and the business succeed. This means being open to feedback from others and giving it in return. It also means recognising that the best ideas might not always be your own.</p><p>Benefits</p><p>We reward strong performers with rapid career advancement. We will never hold you back from taking on more responsibility if you are capable. We host monthly, company-wide hackathons to experiment with new technologies and radical ideas. And you’ll be working in our new, beautiful office space in the heart of central London.</p><h3>How to apply</h3><a href=&quot;http://www.workatviagogo.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>www.workatviagogo.com</a></body></html>",

Our vision is to transform how SaaS tools and infrastructure are bought and sold.</p><p>Choosing SaaS and cloud infrastructure tools is difficult. If you’re a developer looking for a hosting solution, you have hundreds of options and no clear way to sift through them all. We’ve built a community of developers, engineers, CTOs, and VPEs that recommend, review, and share their technology stacks. They have significant buying power and a need for tooling and infrastructure services, from startups to large enterprises. The options they have are confusing and increasing in number by the day - they’re desperate to get help choosing the right solutions. StackShare lets technologists see all the best tools and services, who’s using them, and why.</p><p><strong>OUR TEAM:</strong></p><p>We’re a small distributed team of five, with our main office in San Francisco, CA. We believe every member of the team should own the products they build and have a say in what gets built.</p><p>Our CEO, Yonas has seen Fortune 500 companies use Gartner PDF reports to make software buying decisions when he worked at Accenture; he’s also seen startups make these decisions after joining a YC-backed startup, where he worked on product design and marketing. Yonas then took StackShare through the 500 Startups accelerator and has been leading our growth and marketing efforts. You'll be working directly with Yonas on a daily basis as part of your role.</p><p>The rest of our team comes from companies like Digital Ocean and Citrix.</p><p><strong>YOU:</strong></p><p>As Front-End Engineer, you will influence everything you see on StackShare. You'll help to shape how hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions of developers and engineers build software.</p><p>You have experience building web applications with at least two years of experience using Rails in a production environment, and at least two years using a JavaScript MVC framework (React experience is a major plus). You have experience building APIs. You hate bureaucracies and want to work at an early stage company that has very little processes. You’re comfortable taking the initiative and just building products that you want to use. As an engineer, you should love using StackShare and if you don’t, you should be excited about making it better.</p><p>You’re comfortable working on something different every day as priorities shift. You view engineering as your strongest skill but you're open to doing whatever the company needs including blog posts, customer support, and email copy. You enjoy shipping code and you believe every new feature should be treated as an experiment and measured closely, and you have the experience to prove it. You build with the following in mind: make it work ➤ make it right ➤ make it fast.</p><p><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ve got a good eye for design and UX. </li><li>You’re a StackShare user (include your profile URL in your application). </li><li>You’re familiar with almost every tool and service in StackShare’s stack (<a href=&quot;http://stackshare.io/stackshare&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://stackshare.io/stackshare</a>). </li><li>You’re a tools geek; you sign up for new tools and services just to kick the tires and satisfy your curiosity.</li></ul></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United States</p></dd>        </dl></body></html>",

Excellent technical experts, visionary designers, dynamic and communicative Human Resources team, innovative researchers, magical marketers, entrepreneurial managers. [These are](https://youtu.be/lCHvRN4SPW8) the people that are part of Xpand IT.**ABOUT THE JOB**We are looking for a superb **Front-end Developer**. But, more than just a Developer, we seek a Ninja Engineer in advanced Rich Interfaces.We are looking for someone who is able to use agile methodologies to deliver high-quality and high-performance web application. Almost anyone can program with javascript but few are the ones that use it correctly in a structured manner. We donÃ¢Â Â t pretend to reinvent the wheel, so itÃ¢Â Â s important to know already some of the mainstream frameworks that already do some of the Ã¢Â Â hard stuffÃ¢Â Â  such as Angular.js or React. ItÃ¢Â Â s important to have some knowledge and concern about the final User experience (so many times neglected).A typical day of a Frontend Developer will go from build component oriented and responsive web applications and, as a team member, work with designers and software engineers to ship highly visual products. The technical skills are important, but he should also value the soft skills. Present a proof of concept, discuss requirements with the team, set priorities and appropriate delivery time, being able to share knowledge with the team and produce quality documentation are skills we expect but we will also help to develop.<div>    </div></body></html>",

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to actually have them code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><br><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><br><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><br><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here: <a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><br><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><br><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><br><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><br><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><br><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><br><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><br><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><br><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><br><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><br><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no e-mail checking) but some take more and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements everything else works itself out.</p><br><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><br><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><br><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><br><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><br><p>We have partial test coverage and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><br><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR.</p><br><p>We can one click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><br><p>We can one click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><br><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><br><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><br><p>We work off weekly sprint issue lists in Github.</p><br><p>Our developers float between mobile, desktop and web development. Our future engineers can specialize&nbsp;in one area if that's where their passion is.</p><br><p>Developers get the latest tricked out MacBook Pro and a powerful desktop tower and choice of monitor(s). If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><br><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><br><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self taught.</p><br><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><br><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><br><p>If you did follow directions our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done 'blind'; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code is code and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><br><p>If we like you're refactoring we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. &nbsp;Nothing super deep CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><br><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up with a team interview.</p><br><p>If the team likes you; we'll then setup a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><br><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><br><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to 'your level' in terms of 'get-shit-doneness'.</p><br><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><br><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><br><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not 'doing their dishes' or causing extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><br><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><br><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.</p></body></html>",

But weÃ¢Â Â re even prouder of teaching people how to align their money and their priorities, and in turn changing their lives.&nbsp;Now we need a Full Stack Marketing Developer to help us get the word out and find out how effectively weÃ¢Â Â re doing so!</div><div><br></div><div>You might not have heard of a Ã¢Â Â Full Stack Marketing DeveloperÃ¢Â Â  yet, but you might be one! LetÃ¢Â Â s break this down:</div><div><br></div><div>When we say Full Stack, we mean that youÃ¢Â Â re a programmer at heart, and are comfortable at various levels of the web stack, and are intimately familiar with the following (not exhaustive):<br></div><ul><li>JavaScript</li><li>A Server-side language like Ruby/Java/C#/PHP</li><li>HTML/CSS</li><li>Deploying and maintaining websites/applications on a service like AWS or Heroku.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>In short, youÃ¢Â Â re a Ã¢Â Â Jack of all web trades, master of someÃ¢Â Â .</div><div><br></div><div>And when we say Ã¢Â Â Marketing DeveloperÃ¢Â Â , it means youÃ¢Â Â ll be working with our awesome marketing team, and they will periodically get excited in a meeting and say things like,<br></div><ul><li>Ã¢Â Â I wish that we could hook up an analytics service of some sort to help us figure out where our customers come from, and what our best customer source is!Ã¢Â Â </li><li>Ã¢Â Â After we moved our Wordpress website from a generic host to Heroku, we noticed that sometimes the site is slow. Do you think something is wrong?Ã¢Â Â </li><li>Ã¢Â Â We offer about 120 live classes a week, and there is an API feed from our classes provider that tells us who took the classes. I wish there was a way to know which classes were more effective at retaining customers.Ã¢Â Â </li></ul><div><br></div><div>And to those comments, youÃ¢Â Â ll probably get excited and respond with, Ã¢Â Â I could build that for you!Ã¢Â Â </div><div><br></div><div>ThatÃ¢Â Â s a taste of what youÃ¢Â Â ll be working on. But first, you need to know if youÃ¢Â Â ll even like working with us. We think you will.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></div><div>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or Ã¢Â Â You Need a BudgetÃ¢Â Â  if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Google us</a>, and youÃ¢Â Â ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on peopleÃ¢Â Â s lives.</div><div><br></div><div>WeÃ¢Â Â re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we havenÃ¢Â Â t taken any outside fundingÃ¢Â Â weÃ¢Â Â re in it for the long haul.</div><div><br></div><div>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our<a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>&nbsp;Cultural Manifesto</a>&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;<em><em>click</em></em>&nbsp;with you. If youÃ¢Â Â re nodding emphatically while reading it, youÃ¢Â Â ll probably fit right in!</div><div><br></div><div>First, letÃ¢Â Â s talk about life at YNAB and then weÃ¢Â Â ll go into detail about what weÃ¢Â Â re looking for.<br></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Who youÃ¢Â Â d be working with:</strong></div><div>DonÃ¢Â Â t think cheesy salespeople who do Ã¢Â Â finger-pistolsÃ¢Â Â  at each other and make that annoying sound with their mouths. Think, Ã¢Â Â Woah, IÃ¢Â Â m so glad I joined the marketing team. IÃ¢Â Â ve never laughed this hard before, and dang, I need to up my&nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Telestrations-12-Player-Party-Pack/dp/B0083J768O&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Telestrations</a>&nbsp;skills!Ã¢Â Â </div><div><br></div><div>Lindsey, our Chief Marketing Officer, is in charge of getting the word out about YNAB, and always finds a fun way to do that. Her most recent brainchild was our&nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://www.youneedabudget.com/ynab-mixtape-2017/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>YNAB mix-tape</a>, where-in she wrote and re-recorded budgeting-related lyrics to pop-songs. (We suggest reading the rest of this description while listening to that album.)</div><div><br></div><div>Ryan eats and sleeps digital marketing, but lest you think that sounds boring, you should know that he is the only one on the team that played bass in a band (for which he wrote much of the music), worked on a train for a summer, helped develop a football management video game, and lived in the Canary Islands. Oh, and he recently taught us all how to build an electric guitar.</div><div><br></div><div>Lastly, Lauren is our illustrator/designer. She is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts, _and_ might be single-handedly responsible for all of the WoW achievement points mentioned on our&nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://www.youneedabudget.com/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>About Page</a>. We should also mention that she designed and illustrated that page. So yeah, her list of awesome just keeps going and going.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How YouÃ¢Â Â ll Work at YNAB</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional peopleÃ¢Â Â the kind youÃ¢Â Â ll be excited to work with. HereÃ¢Â Â s how we operate:</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></div><div>WeÃ¢Â Â re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesnÃ¢Â Â t influence productivity. As I write this, Taylor (our CTO) is in, London or Brazil, or maybe back in Austin? Not all of us travel so extensively, but the fact that he does is totally okay because weÃ¢Â Â re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></div><div>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but weÃ¢Â Â re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em><em>minimum</em></em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). ItÃ¢Â Â s important to get out and do something. WeÃ¢Â Â ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></div><div>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. Last year it was a&nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/post/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>gigantic cabin in the mountains</a>. The time before that<a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>&nbsp;it was in Costa Rica</a>. This year is a beach house in the Outer Banks. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Up Your Game</strong></div><div>WeÃ¢Â Â re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!).. Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... itÃ¢Â Â s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;<br></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>If YouÃ¢Â Â re International...</strong></div><div>YouÃ¢Â Â ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, itÃ¢Â Â s all the same to us. YouÃ¢Â Â re part of the team. We are spread all over the world, but for this particular position,&nbsp;we have a strong preference for candidates located +/- three hours from North American Pacific Time.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>If YouÃ¢Â Â re StatesideÃ¢Â Â¦</strong></div><div>YouÃ¢Â Â ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em><em>and your family.</em></em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, weÃ¢Â Â ve got you covered!)</div><div><br></div><div>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNABÃ¢Â Â s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em><em>your retirement</em></em>&nbsp;<em><em>nest egg</em></em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. YouÃ¢Â Â re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, itÃ¢Â Â s great.)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></div><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your Ã¢Â Â Bucket ListÃ¢Â Â  spreadsheet with 50 items. (ThatÃ¢Â Â s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. YouÃ¢Â Â ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>WeÃ¢Â Â re all adults. ThereÃ¢Â Â s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what youÃ¢Â Â re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em><em>standing</em></em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so weÃ¢Â Â ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in peopleÃ¢Â Â s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. ItÃ¢Â Â s amazing. DonÃ¢Â Â t underestimate this one!</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you.&nbsp;You will play a big, big part in&nbsp;helping YNAB become a household name and helping hundreds of thousands of people get control of their money.&nbsp;You will change lives.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Now, back to you, our new Marketing Developer</strong><br></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>&nbsp;If you are the guy or gal weÃ¢Â Â re looking for, youÃ¢Â Â ve already got solid programming experience under your belt.&nbsp;You have experience with both back-end and front-end development, and either already know, or know how to learn about marketing tech like Google Analytics and Intercom.</div><div><br></div><div>You would love building custom solutions, dashboards, and solving Ã¢Â Â attributionÃ¢Â Â  puzzles. When one of those silly marketing people comes to you and says, Ã¢Â Â our conversions in our CRM arenÃ¢Â Â t matching up with our Analytics dashboard,Ã¢Â Â  youÃ¢Â Â d know exactly how to get to the root of the problem. (Probably because you set everything up.) Also, those marketing people arenÃ¢Â Â t silly and you actually consider yourself to be one of them these days.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Ã¢Â Â¨Ã¢Â Â¨Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</strong></div><ul><li>3+ years of extensive web-related programming experience with</li><li>--Client-side language like JavaScript or a variant</li><li>--Server-side language like&nbsp;Ruby on Rails/Java/C#</li><li>Knowledge of:</li></ul><ul><li>--Some HTML/CSS</li><li>--Deploying and maintaining websites/applications on a service like AWS or Heroku.</li><li>--The Mac/Linux command line</li><li>The proven ability to learn new languages and APIs quickly and independently</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Sweet, sweet bonus points (we can dream, right?):</strong><br></div><ul><li>Strong knowledge of standard marketing tech, including:</li><li>--Tracking scripts and pixels</li><li>--Marketing APIÃ¢Â Â s (ads APIs, analytics APIs)</li><li>--Mobile funnel/store attribution tracking</li><li>--Familiarity with databases like MySQL or PostreSQL</li><li>--Social and ppc ad tracking platforms</li><li>--Display network and retargeting integrations</li><li>--Marketing automation systems</li><li>--CRM integrations or custom databases to manage customer data</li><li>--Mobile attribution tracking platforms</li><li>--Google Tag manager or Ã¢Â Â multi-plexerÃ¢Â Â  integration like Segment.io</li><li>Experience creating custom Business Intelligence Dashboards</li><li>Wordpress development</li><li>Ember.js</li><li>DevOps experience with Heroku, nginx, Linux, DNS, CloudFlare, CDNÃ¢Â Â s</li><li>Typescript</li><li>A computer-science background and/or a degree in Computer science</li><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What Success Looks Like:</strong></div><div>YouÃ¢Â Â ll help the marketing team integrate, evaluate, and build the tech they need to succeed. YouÃ¢Â Â ll be solving problems like:<br></div><ul><li>Ã¢Â Â A university wrote to us and wants us to create a branded YNAB signup page for their 10,000 students. How can we hook up our user creation API to this new page that lives on the marketing site?Ã¢Â Â </li><li>Ã¢Â Â We just launched our referral program, but I wish we had a dashboard of some sort that told us how well it was working. What percentage of people are using it? When they use it, how many people do they refer?Ã¢Â Â </li><li>ThereÃ¢Â Â s a new service that helps us attribute our signups to our various online ad platforms. Can you hook it up and help us evaluate it?</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We know our marketing team is awesome and, even though youÃ¢Â Â ll technically be part of the development team too, youÃ¢Â Â ll go to bat for our team in development meetings. YouÃ¢Â Â ll also hit home runs. And you wonÃ¢Â Â t be annoyed by sports metaphors, but also, donÃ¢Â Â t worry, we rarely use them.</div><div><br></div><div>Apart from integrating marketing tech, youÃ¢Â Â ll also have ideas on how we can improve our processes from a tech standpoint. Maybe youÃ¢Â Â ll want to stop FTPing files, and move our marketing site into Git so that itÃ¢Â Â s auto-deployed when we push. Too late - we did that a long time ago, but if we hadnÃ¢Â Â t, you would have made that your first order of business!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How to Apply</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Apply through the link below&nbsp;by 11:59PM on April 9th, 2017.

Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.Ã¢Â Â  &nbsp;</em></div><div><em>Ã¢Â Â  Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></div><div><br></div><div><strong>At Action Verb, you don't have a boss.</strong> &nbsp;Your work is executed autonomously, without micromanagement.</div><div><br></div><div>But Holacracy is not unstructured: you'll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</div><div><br></div><div>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team on a regular basis. &nbsp;We plan to offer employee ownership in the future.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>We've worked really hard to make Action Verb the ideal place for you to work.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</div><div><br></div><div>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</div><div><br></div><div>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. <strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year (or we can match your current salary) plus a great benefits package, and we offer an aggressive raise/bonus every year thereafter based on performance.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, <strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work</strong>. &nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. &nbsp;Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. &nbsp;Then after your first year, we'll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it's more than fair, given the value you've been able to generate for the company.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>We believe that building great products requires great infrastructure.</strong> &nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and almost 100% test coverage. &nbsp;We built our own application deployment system. &nbsp;We self-manage our server stack on Amazon EC2 and custom hardware.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>We believe in using the right tool for the job.</strong> &nbsp;Our core applications are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. &nbsp;We use Rails, React, Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source systems.</div><div><br></div><div>We run Linux (Ubuntu) on our servers, but we support Linux and MacOS as development environments.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>We believe that the best engineers tend to be polyglots with lots of experience.</strong> &nbsp;WeÃ¢Â Â re looking for someone who can bring the following things to the table:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Solid web development skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. &nbsp;Even though we have lots of backend work to keep several people busy, our business is so web-facing that we think every engineer should be familiar with web technologies.</li><li>Firm understanding of how to write secure code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.</li><li>Testing and the ability to write specs (we use Rspec for our Ruby applications, and appropriate unit test frameworks elsewhere)</li><li>Ability to prioritize and make decisions without needing to be micromanaged</li><li>History developing actual SaaS applications that have seen production usage with real customers.</li><li>Truly interested in giving our customers a great experience and able to communicate directly with customers and prospects.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. </strong>&nbsp;If you work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at Action Verb, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull request back to the upstream project. &nbsp;And if you build something from scratch while working here thatÃ¢Â Â s generic and not related to our core products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. &nbsp;WeÃ¢Â Â ll also pay your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>We believe that our products will never be finished.</strong> &nbsp;We are committed to continuously improving our customer experience. &nbsp;We constantly reach

    "content": "*Why iwoca?*<br /><br />A flexible cash flow is critical to the success of any small or mid-sized business. Traditionally, banks have neglected the millions of European SMEs because their processes have been too slow, rigid and costly to serve them effectively. By using cutting-edge technology and harnessing more data, iwoca is rapidly reinventing business finance, developing new ways to provide fast and flexible access to credit, enabling our customers to flourish.<br /><br />Chris and James launched iwoca in 2012; since then we’ve made tens of thousands of credit decisions and lent over £150m to ten thousand SMEs across UK, Poland, Germany and Spain. Along the way we built a high-tech platform from scratch, won numerous awards and grown a highly cosmopolitan, fun and vibrant team of 130 people based in London. We represent a diverse range of backgrounds and we’re united in our mission to make business finance simple, seamless, and powerful.<br /><br />We’ve come a long way in the last five years, and yet are just at the start of a journey that promises many more exciting times ahead. We recently closed a £46m funding round, giving us the firepower to accelerate our development. To drive this growth we’re looking for people who are smart, motivated and humble, who want to develop themselves and push the boundaries of their own performance while building a business we can all be really proud of.<br /><br /><br />*About the role:*<br /><br />At iwoca we are dedicated to building the smartest lending platform in the world as we believe that finance should be as simple, seamless and powerful as electricity.

You could be doing anything from working on our REST API, asynchronous processing, automated testing patterns or contributing to our underwriting tools.<br />We could include a load of technical acronyms here and tell you about all the greenfield projects you could be working on, but ultimately it is important for you to know that the environment here is always exciting, challenging and fast-paced. We believe in investing in research to find the best possible outcome.<br /><br />Therefore we are looking for passionate developers with an eagerness to work in a collaborative environment to build an awesome product that will help SME’s across the world.<br /><br />We run our Django-powered site on AWS, use asynchronous tools (Twisted, Celery) for time-consuming tasks and scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, pandas) for risk aspects. Application orchestration is done with Docker and Ansible and our monitoring is set up using StatsD, Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana.<br /><br />*We are looking for someone with:*<br /><br />* Experience developing in Python (we use Python)*<br />* Knowledge of SQL and NoSQL databases (ideally MongoDB and PostgreSQL)<br />* Knowledge of web frameworks (we use Django)<br />* Demonstrable experience creating robust, clever and scalable applications<br />* Experience doing it all: designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining<br />* Ability to manage projects, priorities, deadlines and deliverables (being autonomous is extremely important for us)<br /><br />If you don’t know Python but are familiar with programming languages like Erlang, Haskell, Scala, Lisp, Clojure, or F#, we would still be keen to hear from you.",

    "title": "Junior Full-Stack Developer",
    "content": "THE COMPANY<br />weseethrough is a tech-driven market research startup. We’re less than two years old, and we’ve already won large contracts from big-name clients like Unilever and we won the 2015 MRS award for innovation in research methodology. Business is booming.<br /><br />We help our clients understand their consumers’ real behaviour: how they use their products, how they interact with advertising, how they perceive brands. Traditionally this has been done through surveys and focus groups, or sending researchers to participants’ homes as they use cleaning or food products etc. These approaches have major drawbacks:<br /><br />Reported behaviour and actual behaviour can be very different. People might claim they only add one teaspoonful of salt, but they actually add three… or they think they take 20 minutes to clean a room, but actually take 40.<br /><br />Sending a researcher to observe someone in their homes as they use a product is expensive, and it’s hard to get participants to relax and act naturally when there’s a stranger watching them!<br />We address these issues by giving participants wearable devices like Google Glass or GoPro to wear as they perform activities like cooking or cleaning. We use these devices to record hundreds of hours of first-person video. We then use our Haystack platform to find the 0.1% of the footage that’s insightful: the moments which help our clients better understand their customers.<br /><br />We’ve conducted these studies in >20 countries across five continents; from Tokyo to Lagos to Moscow to Milan. To give an example, we had a client in Brazil who wanted to understand why their recently-launched house cleaning products were not selling well. To investigate, we got participants to clean their homes with Google Glass. As well as recording video and audio, our custom Glass software posed pre-recorded Portuguese interview questions as they went around their homes, using proximity beacons in each room to ask the right questions at the right time. We were able to use the recordings to write a report for a client giving deep insights into common behaviours, and a few quirks you wouldn’t think to ask about, like participants throwing buckets of undiluted bleach over their floors without moving furniture out of the way!<br />A more detailed example in this case study.<br /><br />OUR PLATFORM<br />Our platform is all about how to mine video from market research studies for interesting, insightful content. Other platforms focus on interview videos, where someone describes their experiences with a product or service – as such, such platforms focus on transcribing the video.<br />Rather than reported behaviour from interviews, we focus on consumers’ actual behaviour using GoPros on chest- or headstraps, Google Glass, movement sensors, eye tracking glasses, and other biometric sensors. Like our competitors, we subtitle videos, but that’s not enough to understand participants’ behaviour. So our platform allows us to mark things that *happen* in the videos, like a stock cube being chopped in half or two cleaning products being mixed together, and things like the products that are seen on screen.<br />Much of our video analysis is done by the crowd at present – a key technical challenge for us is how to best leverage recent leaps and bounds in machine vision to automate video tagging.<br /><br />THE ROLE<br />The role is twofold:<br /><br />1. Devops.<br />Our platform is split between:<br />A pair of dedicated Linux servers (prod + test), running node.js, a lot of batch video processing with ffmpeg, and a bit of data in Redis<br />AWS<br />Also, often when we receive a lot of videos from a client for processing, the project managers need a helping hand organising it.<br /><br />2. Full-stack dev and fix.<br />We’re looking to incrementally rewrite our platform, which currently uses Angular 1.3 and node.js. We have a variety of user types (end clients, researchers, crowd video taggers and transcribers, project managers, video uploaders…) that we want to migrate to a new platform we’re starting to build with ReactJS, one user type at a time. We’re going to have a relatively protracted transition period where both run in parallel, so part of the role will be about patching up the old, part of it will be about creating the new.<br /><br />CULTURE<br /><br />We’re a small startup, and it’s crucial that you’re comfortable with all that that means!<br />You’ll have a lot of responsibility early on, and if you do a good job you’ll see a real difference to how the company is doing.<br /><br />We’re likely to ask you to go outside your comfort zone and perform tasks outside a narrow reading of your job specification.<br /><br />Lateral thinking and problem solving for unfamiliar tasks are hugely valued here.<br />There’s no room for big egos here! In large companies, it’s possible for an individual to do well as the company flounders – here, we all make a success of the company, or… we don’t.<br />We want someone who is hungry to work in a startup in general, and our company in particular. Startups have a very different culture from large corporates and you should have a clear idea of this going in, even if you’ve not worked for a startup before.<br /><br />REQUIRED SKILLSET<br />Linux system administration (we use Ubuntu)<br />HTML & CSS<br />Angular 1.x or React or both<br />ES5<br />Deep understanding of Chrome developer tools<br /><br />NICE TO HAVE (can learn on the job)<br />ES2015 / ES6+<br />node.js<br />AWS – currently we use S3, CloudFront, EC2; may start using Elastic Transcoder and others in future<br />Build automation tooling (we’re using Bamboo)<br />git<br />Redis<br />ffmpeg / video processing<br />JIRA<br />Performance test experience",

The aim was to reduce the development time of complex software and reduce maintenance. <br /><br />I had started to use the framework to produce a large CRM / project management / 360 business tool, the aim was primarily to prove the framework, as well as hopefully get a return on my investment.<br /><br />The project had to pivot slightly and now there are three projects, <br />The main project is the RAD, where one can design, build and publish your software. - &quot;LayrCake RAD&quot;:http://rad.layrcake.com <br />---- There is also a Xamarin mobile app from which you can design, build and publish also.<br /><br />The second is still a work in progress - the CRM -  &quot;LayrCake CRM&quot;:http://crm.layrcake.com<br />you can see the progress at the following:<br /><br />&quot;LayrCake RAD&quot;:http://rad.layrcake.com<br />&quot;LayrCake CRM&quot;:http://crm.layrcake.com<br /><br />(go to the data table diagram and wait a second)<br /><br />I'm looking for some one cool, creative and with personal drive, e.g. Fast, to join and do AngularJs and Javascript with a background in C# and an interest in learning. <br />We'll also be doing some outsourcing work for companies.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk to recruitment agencies, or outsourcing companies so please don't contact me.<br /><br />This may be suitable for a freelancer, part timer or full time.<br /><br />At the moment, you can work remotely but I'd like the company to get offices in Shoreditch once I've secured funding. (I live in West Ealing, so will also be commuting)<br /><br />If this sound like something that you'd be passionate about and would like to get involved, it'll be great you have you join and make a team.<br /><br />Cheers , Hugh ",

Why does the company not grant everybody 50 vacation days by default and encourage employees to work more by paying out small bonuses (like $500) for not taking more than 50% of their vacation days?<p>It's because they want the employees to not take <i>any</i> days off. Peer-pressure is insanely strong in those environments. You are supposed to feel bad to letting your colleagues do the work, while you <i>voluntarily</i> (!) take time off. Especially at start-ups there is always something for you to work on.</p><p>As an employee it's easier to agree on like 25 vacation days/year beforehand because then it's in the contract and both parties can point to it when there are problems. If a colleague has a problem with someone taking more vacations days, it comes down to their own inability to negotiate more days for themselves; not to some &quot;backstabber&quot; leaving their colleague behind for some fun.</p><p>As I said, there are cases where unlimited vacation days work out but I would say those are the lucky 1%.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div><br>*********** loumf ***********<br><div>                  <span>Your understanding of what unlimited vacation means is not correct.

    "content": "<html><head></head><body><div>                  <span>Wisdom | Cryptocurrency Applied to APIs | Moraga, CA | REMOTE/ONSITE | Founder<p>Wisdom is a project-in-progress I have been working on for a few years which applies cryptopayments to API method calls to implement the <i>402 Payment Required</i> response code for HTTP based requests using Bitcoin or other cyptocurrencies, which will eventually add support for the Lightning Protocol. A PoC of an early version of the idea was featured here on HN 3 years ago: <a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8069386&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8069386</a>. Time has passed since then and the idea, and technologies required for building it, have evolved. It is my belief the time for this idea, from a market-perspective, has arrived.</p><p>The service will be designed to improve the process of integrating a company's API product with channel partners, either on-prem or in a hosted manner, with the intent to increase pass-through revenue on the API calls a company provides, while providing a simple federated layer based on blochchain backed data structures. This idea is in pre-funding, so I'm explicitly stating anyone interested in my idea should consider their founder-level involvement as purely self-choice driven. Influencing, making or removing choice for you in this regard is illogical and irrational, given the state of the company (non-existent) and funding (also non-existent). However, if you hold the view that the existing methods for securing the Internet's infrastructure are woefully inadequate and you feel applying cryptocurrency to APIs could make companies more money by securing them against use by limiting calls with payments, then you should contact me and we should have a conversation about it.</p><p>Expertise in building scalable API calls with microservices-based architecture is desired, but a more general gift in development is also welcome. I code in Python, Javascript and C++, and am decently good at running infrastructure, given my history. My primary function is strategy, operations and architecture. I do not visualize, so I tend to communicate differently.</p><p>My email address is in my profile here on HN. Happy to just discuss the idea, if you are interested, as opposed to any expectation of finding someone this early on to join me.</p><p>If you've read this far, I appreciate you. I will note that this idea can be applied to AI in a less than obvious way. This reason is the primary purpose of the project, but making revenue in other ways first remains important.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div></body></html>",

Several of our engineers are core contributors to React Native, and we regularly collaborate with Facebook and other companies on the direction of the framework.</p><p>Our technology is built around an Android/iOS application which allows developers to load their JavaScript projects on the fly with no native build dependencies. Out of the box, developers using Expo get access to native mobile APIs like push notifications, camera, maps, and more (<a href=&quot;https://docs.getexponent.com/versions/v15.0.0/sdk/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://docs.getexponent.com/versions/v15.0.0/sdk/index.html</a>).</p><p>We have a lot of irons in the fire, and we're looking for engineers who can comfortably own and work on multiple projects.

We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog!

We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time.

We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re hiring both engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as those who started their careers just a couple years ago.

Your&nbsp;very strong interpersonal skills would enable you to confidently interact with the client. When you think a better approach could be taken, you'd share that knowledge and your reasoning with the rest of the team.

We are a profitable, 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 50 employees and $22M annual revenue over the past five years.</p><p>As a remote company, our development team is set up to empower individuals. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes and inefficient systems, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. We believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of <a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>The Joel Test</a> (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), follow the best practices for continuous deployment (anything that is merged following a pull request goes straight to production), and have implemented a declarative unidirectional data flow system (like <a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/flux/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Flux</a>, but on steroids) for our most complex logic. Difficult projects with extensive cascading data dependencies take days instead of months, allowing us to provide best-in-class design tools and iterate more quickly than our competitors with much larger development teams.</p><p>We are seeking an ambitious and nice engineering leader who shares our passion for building a great software company. As a 100% remote organization (<a href=&quot;https://remote.co/company/collage-com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>read about our remote workplace at remote.co</a>), this is a unique opportunity to define how a software team should communicate, have fun, and produce results without being confined to an office. You will join a team of managers who are excited about improving best practices, teaching developers, and delivering a great product. Our goal is to continue our fast pace of growth while creating the best possible work environment for engineers to be happy, productive, and grow professionally.</p><p><a href=&quot;http://jobs.collage.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Learn more about working and developing software at Collage.com.</a></p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Be the people manager for several engineers of varying skill levels, teaching them to communicate effectively, write excellent code, and test it well through code reviews, performance reviews, and regular one-on-one feedback.</li><li>Assign work, help developers overcome roadblocks, and oversee testing to ship high-quality software on schedule.</li><li>Develop software hands-on at all points in the stack, walking others through their most difficult tasks and pushing projects to completion by working on areas where you have expertise.</li><li>Balance product work with eliminating technical debt, establishing processes, and adjusting responsibilities to maximize your team's efficiency and plan for the future.</li><li>Work closely with product managers to establish our product roadmap.

Like all new members of our engineering team, you will start with a brief phone screening interview that tests basic Javascript coding ability. After that, you will speak with another software engineering manager for an hour to assess your qualifications, make sure there is a mutual cultural fit, and answer any questions you have about the position.</p><p>After we have verified your background, experience, and basic coding ability, we will give you a take-home assignment. The goal of this series of assignments is to simulate real on-the-job work at Collage.com as closely as possible and assess your performance. The first part, which we also give to non-management engineering applicants, involves implementing a basic UI from scratch in Javascript. The second part is a code review test where we ask you to provide feedback on a sample pull request for adherence to general best practices like object-oriented design patterns, avoiding repetition, etc. Finally, we ask you to write a technical specification that tells a developer how to structure code given a set of high-level requirements. The whole test is about four hours long and takes the place of an on-site technical interview.</p><p>Following the take-home test, you will have phone calls with a developer you will be managing, a non-technical product manager, and both founders of the company. The goal of these interviews is to develop a mutual understanding of what it would be like to work together and assess strengths and weaknesses not captured by earlier parts of the interview process. While we only plan to hire one candidate for this position, we will make an offer as early as possible after the final interview.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl></body></html>",

We strive to do this by providing superior software and excellent customer service. We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the [TODAY Show](http://blog.collage.com/2013/10/25/total-request-collage-blanket-for-carson-daly/), [The View](http://blog.collage.com/2015/10/05/collage-com-on-abcs-the-view/), and [Good Morning America](http://blog.collage.com/2015/08/06/collage-com-on-good-morning-america-with-up-to-76-off-gallery-wrap-canvases/) many times. We are a profitable, 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 50 employees and $22M annual revenue over the past five years.As a remote company, our development team is set up to empower individuals. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes and inefficient systems, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. We believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), follow the best practices for continuous deployment (anything that is merged following a pull request goes straight to production), and have implemented a declarative unidirectional data flow system (like [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but on steroids) for our most complex logic. Difficult projects with extensive cascading data dependencies take days instead of months, allowing us to provide best-in-class design tools and iterate more quickly than our competitors with much larger development teams.We are seeking an ambitious and nice engineering leader who shares our passion for building a great software company. As a 100% remote organization ([read about our remote workplace at remote.co](https://remote.co/company/collage-com/)), this is a unique opportunity to define how a software team should communicate, have fun, and produce results without being confined to an office. You will join a team of managers who are excited about improving best practices, teaching developers, and delivering a great product. Our goal is to continue our fast pace of growth while creating the best possible work environment for engineers to be happy, productive, and grow professionally.[Learn more about working and developing software at Collage.com.](http://jobs.collage.com/) __Responsibilities__* Be the people manager for several engineers of varying skill levels, teaching them to communicate effectively, write excellent code, and test it well through code reviews, performance reviews, and regular one-on-one feedback.* Assign work, help developers overcome roadblocks, and oversee testing to ship high-quality software on schedule.* Develop software hands-on at all points in the stack, walking others through their most difficult tasks and pushing projects to completion by working on areas where you have expertise.* Balance product work with eliminating technical debt, establishing processes, and adjusting responsibilities to maximize your team's efficiency and plan for the future.* Work closely with product managers to establish our product roadmap. Specify technical solutions to customer needs and define our code architecture.__Required Qualifications__* Excellent full-stack developer with several years of coding experience who can write clean, well-structured web applications and push others to do the same. Must be familiar with MV* Javascript frameworks, PHP, and SQL.* Demonstrated ability to manage and grow a team of software developers.* Passion for teaching - You prioritize helping others to become autonomous above stepping in and doing things yourself.* Strong writer who can clearly explain technical issues to a non-technical audience.* Exceptionally meticulous and organized - With several direct reports working on different projects and no physical office space, you will have to juggle many responsibilities at once.* Bachelor's degree in computer science or equivalent work experience.__Benefits and Perks__* Working from home makes it easier to focus on results and develop professionally while spending less time commuting. ([See our opinion piece on perks and work-life balance at mlive.com](http://www.mlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/08/perks_schmerks_the_one_thing_t.html).)* 401(k) plan, home internet reimbursement, and $3,000 / year in free Collage.com products plus employee discount for friends and family.* Collage.com pays 100% of the premium for full health, vision and dental insurance coverage for you and your family in a high-quality Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO plan.* Flexible work schedule and unlimited vacation policy (work hard and take time when you need it).* We'll pay for any computer and home office equipment (within reason) that will help you work better.__The Interview Process__We strive to provide a transparent interview process that maximizes the chances of success for qualified candidates. Like all new members of our engineering team, you will start with a brief phone screening interview that tests basic Javascript coding ability. After that, you will speak with another software engineering manager for an hour to assess your qualifications, make sure there is a mutual cultural fit, and answer any questions you have about the position.After we have verified your background, experience, and basic coding ability, we will give you a take-home assignment. The goal of this series of assignments is to simulate real on-the-job work at Collage.com as closely as possible and assess your performance. The first part, which we also give to non-management engineering applicants, involves implementing a basic UI from scratch in Javascript. The second part is a code review test where we ask you to provide feedback on a sample pull request for adherence to general best practices like object-oriented design patterns, avoiding repetition, etc. Finally, we ask you to write a technical specification that tells a developer how to structure code given a set of high-level requirements. The whole test is about four hours long and takes the place of an on-site technical interview.Following the take-home test, you will have phone calls with a developer you will be managing, a non-technical product manager, and both founders of the company. The goal of these interviews is to develop a mutual understanding of what it would be like to work together and assess strengths and weaknesses not captured by earlier parts of the interview process. While we only plan to hire one candidate for this position, we will make an offer as early as possible after the final interview.</body></html>",

What will you be working on - BNBHelper<br /><br />BNBHelper and its core product Zerlock is a suite of tools to help different players in the short-term holiday rental market streamline their business. The sharing-economy in real-estate has been a buzz word for the last few years and will only be increasing in its reach over the next 5 years and with increasing players in the market, there is a need for technological tools to help such market participants. BNBHelper is creating a suite of such tools<br /><br />This startup comes out of my experience in the real-estate market for last 3 years to simplify pain points for hosts in the short-term rental market in UK and abroad. It is being backed by some high net-worth property investors in UK and by BOK Construction (http://www.bokconstruction.co.uk/) a London based construction company focussing on high-end construction<br /><br />Different coding/development streams include:<br /><br />* AI engine / chat bot for replying to guest enquiries and post-booking questions faster<br />* Scraping of quasi-open data to infer market competition analysis<br />* Home automation in several different ways to have total picture of when guests check in, which rooms they use and when, improved security and improved customer-service messaging. We will play around with various Internet of Things technologies available today and pick the best ones and integrate them in our project and improve upon them<br />* A guest-composite score analysis using heavy use of scraping, machine learning and other algorithms to separate good guests from bad guests.<br />* Scaling up all of the above to a production-ready level<br /><br />There is existing code-base for all of these above but a lot of ongoing work is still necessary and in the business roadmap.<br /><br /><br />h2. Who a we looking for:<br /><br />A junior developer with “stay hungry, stay foolish” mindset, who has proven track record of “hacking” from his bedroom/dorm-room for a considerable period of time.<br /><br />You love knowing and learning new technologies and using them towards practical applications and solving real-life problems and making cool things<br /><br />Solving that nagging bug, or learning that new intricate package to fit into your codebase keeps you up till late night.<br /><br />You can think and build things from first-principles when necessary, but also know how to use existing packages and join their dots and integrate them well to the desired end.<br /><br />College-programming degree is great, but not essential. I have mentored and helped junior developers in the past to the point that they single-handedly maintain full-stack (front end + backend) code bases for actual commercial apps for well-funded startups currently, and I will be helping you out in a similar manner and you will work very closely with me (at least 3-4 hours of face to face time each day)<br /><br />You should be able pick up things fast as you will have a lot to learn. I encourage you having an aim to perhaps starting your startup within 2-3 year’s time from all the knowledge gained (tech/marketing/fund-raising) from this experience.<br /><br />If you are keen, I will be happy to expand your role to more than a developer (to help in marketing/business/fund-raise) in the near future, given your enthusiasm and ability. It is in fact encouraged.<br /><br />The job requires a good attitude towards problem-solving and debugging, and working under tight-schedule.<br /><br />You should aim to work 5-5.5 days a week, sometimes under tight schedule but when there are no pressing needs, you are welcome to work on your own projects for 1 day a week – which I will happily work with you on/mentor/advise/invest into if appealing.<br /><br />h2. Compensation - £27000 per annum equivalent<br /><br />Probationary period: 2-5 months depending on your current experience – GBP 1000 / month (net in hand)<br />Post probation – GBP 1500 / month (net in hand)<br /><br />You would have a probationary period of 3 months, post which we will have a longer term permanent engagement agreement.<br /><br />Bonus – after completion of 1 year – GBP 3500 minimum contractual (and more depending on you performance and business performance)<br /><br /><br />You can expect periodic revisions in compensation every year at least (if not earlier) and being assigned stock options after the first fund-raise of BNBHelper. Also you can expect very healthy increase after the completion of 1st year.<br /><br />If you have present commitments, for the right candidate a part-time agreement for an initial period (at a different compensation level) will also be considered till you free up to become full-time",
