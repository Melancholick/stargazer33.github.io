Why \u003cbr /\u003ewould anybody let me near the code, you ask? \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWell, it\u0027s because I\u0027m the founder and owner of How-To Geek, the best (and \u003cbr /\u003ebiggest) technology how-to site on the internet. And I\u0027m great at hacking \u003cbr /\u003ethings together to make them work, but writing maintainable code? Terrible. \u003cbr /\u003eDocumenting said terrible code? Ironically, also terrible.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eYour job, should you choose to accept the awesomeness of it, would be to throw \u003cbr /\u003eout all of my terrible code (with glee) and create a well-documented, \u003cbr /\u003emaintainable, secure, and most of all, blazing fast infrastructure. Don\u0027t \u003cbr /\u003eforget the glee -- you\u0027re also required to make fun of my code at every \u003cbr /\u003eopportunity.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI know, it sounds like loads of fun and you\u0027ve probably already applied, but \u003cbr /\u003ekeep in mind that we\u0027re running a very high-traffic production WordPress-based \u003cbr /\u003esite -- during peak times we\u0027re seeing 30-50 page views per second, and even in \u003cbr /\u003ethe middle of the night, we\u0027re talking about hundreds to thousands of hits \u003cbr /\u003eevery single second of every day.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTo handle the huge load of daily visitors, we\u0027re using Fastly\u0027s amazing \u003cbr /\u003evarnish-based caching servers.
