    "content": "<html><head></head><body><div>Thanks for the interest in us and our Support Manager position. We appreciate you taking the time to consider what we have to offer.</div><div><br></div><div>Building a digital signage company doesnÃ¢Â Â t happen without an amazing support team looking after our customers and advocating for continuous improvement on their behalf. Our support team needs a Manager to lead continuous improvement with touch analysis and reduction, next issue avoidance, and perception engineering, to continuously lower customer effort in our day to day interactions. But even more importantly, the leader we hire understands that building self serve portals is what really matters. Are you this person?</div><div><br></div><div>If the above sounds like you, and if you love Scrum to organize teams, you work Kanban style, and you use Lean to continuously build, measure and learn, then we have the place for you!</div><div><br></div><div>Still with me? Assuming you are... You are a tech geek. You understand software, hardware, and all of the moving parts in between and you get excited if you have to roll your sleeves up and move a few boards around, or figure out just where the zeros and ones are going, and why they arenÃ¢Â Â t going in the direction they should be. And to publish your findings you are more than comfortable with pushing some HTML into your editor of choice and hacking a few lines of javascript that you cut and pasted from the web to make it move and entertain, just for the fun of it. </div><div><br></div><div>You are that digital person that can easily share your technical know how with others. You are a natural communicator, coach, and teacher. You make the complex simple whether in writing or informally presenting on video hangouts. </div><div><br></div><div>And letÃ¢Â Â s face it. Support is all about solving problems. Problems donÃ¢Â Â t stress you out. You know how to get things done, in the right order, and you are always that person in the room that calmly leads the discussion from problem to solution. You are not an adrenaline junkie looking for the next fire, or worse, making them just to keep things interesting, you donÃ¢Â Â t take anything personally, you know slow and steady always wins the race.</div><div><br></div><div>Added bonuses - you know ZenDesk inside out; you can whip out SLAÃ¢Â Â s, drive a few events with Triggers, or just wait for time to pass with Automations, and what you can get done with Liquid Markup excites you. You have a whole zen like (pun intended) approach to managing the workflow from Zendesk. And when not in Zendesk you live in G-Suite, move cards with Trello, talk all day long with the teams in HipChat, and when it gets complicated you move from Google Hangout to Hangout to get things done fast.</div><div><br></div><div>Did I mention weÃ¢Â Â re a virtual company? You are comfortable with and motivated by remote work; you have the discipline to self start, self manage, and get one thing done at a time. If you happen to live in the Toronto, Ontario area, or Lenexa, Kansas, thatÃ¢Â Â s another bonus as we have offices in both places for meetups and access to equipment.</div><div><br></div><div>At this point you are probably wondering just who are these people?

    "content": "<html><head></head><body><div>                  <span>Expensify - Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA  Designer, Infrastructure, Customer Success<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don't suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=&quot;http://we.are.expensify.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com. We are excited to hear from you!<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div></body></html>",

Check out our website, especially the blog \n<http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/> and resources \n<http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/> sections.\n\n * Gmail\n * Google Docs\n * Asana\n * WordPress\n * Skype\n * Slack\nWe are especially interested in people who can tackle very technical subjects, \nlike resources on programming languages. A good example of this is our resource \non theForth programming language \n<http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/forth-programming/>.\n\nArticles are often 1000+ words (and we even have one 60,000 word FAQ!). We are \nvery clear on what we want on every project.\n\nMost articles can be researched online. However, some will require expert \ninterviews via Skype or phone(we’ll cover costs).\n\nWorkload\n\nWe have as much work as you can handle. We have freelance writers producing as \nmuch as 10,000 words per week. We are looking for writers available of a \nminimum of one day/week, due to the overhead of managing many writers.\n\nWe don’t micro-manage. We provide projects with descriptions including due \ndates and required length. There is sometimes communication back and forth\n(Asana is great for this).\n\nBut mostly, you write the article and turn it in, we edit it and publish. \nWriters invoice every other week, and get paid in US dollars by PayPal or wire \ntransfer.",

    "content": "Building a digital signage company doesn’t happen without an amazing support \nteam looking after our customers and advocating for continuous improvement on \ntheir behalf. Our support team needs a Manager to lead continuous improvement \nwith touch analysis and reduction, next issue avoidance, and perception \nengineering, to continuously lower customer effort in our day to day \ninteractions. But even more importantly, the leader we hire understands that \nbuilding self serve portals is what really matters. Are you this person?\n\nIf the above sounds like you, and if you love Scrum to organize teams, you \nwork Kanban style, and you use Lean to continuously build, measure and learn, \nthen we have the place for you!\n\nStill with me? Assuming you are... You are a tech geek. You understand \nsoftware, hardware, and all of the moving parts in between and you get excited \nif you have to roll your sleeves up and move a few boards around, or figure out \njust where the zeros and ones are going, and why they aren’t going in the \ndirection they should be. And to publish your findings you are more than \ncomfortable with pushing some HTML into your editor of choice and hacking a few \nlines of javascript that you cut and pasted from the web to make it move and \nentertain, just for the fun of it.\n\nYou are that digital person that can easily share your technical know how with \nothers. You are a natural communicator, coach, and teacher. You make the \ncomplex simple whether in writing or informally presenting on video hangouts.\n\nAnd let’s face it. Support is all about solving problems. Problems don’t \nstress you out. You know how to get things done, in the right order, and you \nare always that person in the room that calmly leads the discussion from \nproblem to solution. You are not an adrenaline junkie looking for the next \nfire, or worse, making them just to keep things interesting, you don’t take \nanything personally, you know slow and steady always wins the race.\n\nAdded bonuses - you know ZenDesk inside out; you can whip out SLA’s, drive a \nfew events with Triggers, or just wait for time to pass with Automations, and \nwhat you can get done with Liquid Markup excites you. You have a whole zen like \n(pun intended) approach to managing the workflow from Zendesk. And when not in \nZendesk you live in G-Suite, move cards with Trello, talk all day long with the \nteams in HipChat, and when it gets complicated you move from Google Hangout to \nHangout to get things done fast.\n\nDid I mention we’re a virtual company? You are comfortable with and motivated \nby remote work; you have the discipline to self start, self manage, and get one \nthing done at a time. If you happen to live in the Toronto, Ontario area, or \nLenexa, Kansas, that’s another bonus as we have offices in both places for \nmeetups and access to equipment.\n\nAt this point you are probably wondering just who are these people? Say no \nmore, here’s a quick video introduction to our story (https://goo.gl/gvkqFr \n<https://goo.gl/gvkqFr>), how we work (https://goo.gl/4nB7Ev \n<https://goo.gl/4nB7Ev>) and how we pay (https://goo.gl/EYpwBQ \n<https://goo.gl/EYpwBQ>). Speaking of payment... We are paying an annual base \nsalary of $65,000 to $85,000 depending upon your experience, and you will also \nparticipate in the company profit sharing plan and benefits.",

We appreciate you taking the time to consider what we have to offer.</div><div><br></div><div>Building a digital signage company doesnÃ¢Â Â t happen without an amazing support team looking after our customers and advocating for continuous improvement on their behalf. Our team needs a new member who is the ultimate tech geek, you are that Ã¢Â Â digitalÃ¢Â Â  person. You understand software, hardware, and all of the moving parts in between and you get excited if you have to roll your sleeves up and move a few boards around, or figure out just where the zeros and ones are going, and why they arenÃ¢Â Â t going in the direction they should be. And to publish your findings you are more than comfortable with pushing some HTML into your editor of choice and hacking a few lines of javascript that you cut and pasted from the web to make it move and entertain, just for the fun of it. </div><div><br></div><div>You are that digital person that all of your friends come to for technical help or advice. You can easily share your technical know how with others, you are a natural communicator that makes the complex simple whether in writing or verbally.</div><div><br></div><div>And letÃ¢Â Â s face it. Support is all about solving problems. Problems donÃ¢Â Â t stress you out. You know how to get things done, in the right order, and you are always the level headed person in the room when everyone else is getting excited. You donÃ¢Â Â t take anything personally, you know slow and steady always wins the race.</div><div><br></div><div>Added bonus you know all about the importance of touch reduction, next issue avoidance and perception engineering and you apply it to every ticket that comes your way. And speaking of tickets, you know ZenDesk inside out, and when not in Zendesk you live in G-Suite, move cards with Trello, talk all day long with your peers in HipChat, and when it gets complicated you move from Google Hangout to Hangout to get things done fast.</div><div><br></div><div>Did I mention weÃ¢Â Â re a virtual company?
