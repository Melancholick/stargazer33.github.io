We are looking for folks with a background in systems administration, operations engineering, and who enjoy building and operating production infrastructure.This could be the right opportunity for you if you want to help design, build, and operate the services that are at the core of how Travis CI runs continuous integration and deployment services for our many thousands of open source and commercial users.As an infrastructure operations engineer, you will be responsible for building scalable, testable, and repeatable infrastructure through automation. YouÃ¢Â Â ll help us with the infrastructure components and services that can be relied on and scale to running hundreds of thousands of CI jobs. YouÃ¢Â Â ll participate in a 24x7 on-call rotation that is composed of folks from across all of TravisÃ¢Â Â s engineering teams.You should be proficient with written and asynchronous communication, and value building working relationships with Builders in remote locations. You have an excellent track record of writing and maintaining great documentation.You value and are comfortable with contributing to open source software as part of your day to day work.You will be part of an environment that is spread across time zones and where communication happens primarily using text and video chat. We value empathy and clear communication, and the importance of building a diverse and vibrant workplace.You can expect to help us continue growing our engineering and people culture in a way thatÃ¢Â Â s healthy and vibrant.----__REQUIREMENTS__Desired Skills &amp; ExperienceThe requirements and experience below outlines what we need to help us manage and grow our production build infrastructure. Ideally youÃ¢Â Â ll have experience with several of these, but more important than the specific technologies, languages, and tools is that youÃ¢Â Â re interested in helping us in building our culture. While we donÃ¢Â Â t apply DevOps as a label to any particular team or area of our week, we do feel our engineering and operations embody the things that DevOps represents. We emphasise shared trust and responsibility, building automated and repeatable processes, continuous learning and improvement, blameless incident handling and postmortems, a strong belief in people over technology, empathy, and infrastructure as code.* You should be familiar with the practices and principles of building modern distributed software systems.* You are comfortable with creating automation tooling.* You have a background and interest in working with Ruby or Go.* You have experience designing, building, and operating production infrastructure that often combines both hosted and in-house services.* YouÃ¢Â Â re comfortable discussing the tradeoffs of building vs buying with regard to things like monitoring, metrics, logging, compute resources, etc.* You have built and maintained production systems running on cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services, VMware, or Google Cloud Platform. ItÃ¢Â Â s more important to us that you have an understanding of how and where these kinds of services are used than requiring you to have deep knowledge of them.* You have a good understanding of containerization tools like Docker, the benefits and tradeoffs of using them, and you are interested in implementing and operating infrastructure that incorporates them.* You have experience with Chef, Puppet, Ansible, or other modern configuration management tooling.* You are familiar with Terraform, Packer, or other tools that support the values of infrastructure as code.* You have experience with automating one or more cloud platforms through their APIs and SDKs. Familiarity with the vSphere API and SDK is a huge bonus.* You have a demonstrated desire and ability to learn.Tools and Technologies We UseWe have a pretty diverse set of technologies that make up our stack. The list below highlights many of the key ones, and should give you a sense of what tools and technologies youÃ¢Â Â d be working with day to day.* Compute Environments  * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)  * Google Compute Engine (GCE)  * VMware vSphere (Private hosted environment)  * Docker (runs inside both EC2 and GCE)* Operating Systems/Versions  * macOS - (10.9, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12)  * Ubuntu Linux - (12.04, 14.04)  * Amazon Linux (NAT and routing services)  * pfSense (NAT and routing services)* Programming Languages  * Ruby  * Go  * Shell scripting* Data Stores  * PostgreSQL  * Redis  * RabbitMQ* Automation Tools  * Chef  * Terraform  * Packer* Productivity Tools/Services  * GitHub  * Travis CI (of course ^_^ )  * Slack  * Librato  * Papertrail  * HelpScout----__BENEFITS__Being a distributed team, you can work from wherever you want. You donÃ¢Â Â t have to go to Berlin, but weÃ¢Â Â re happy to fly you in for your on-boarding, and for additional visits according to our office visit policy for remote team members.You choose your working hours. We understand life comes with responsibilities and complications. We have families and personal lives and we encourage all our builders to spend time tending to them.Minimum paid leave per year is 25 days.Your health insurance is partially covered by Travis CI. WeÃ¢Â Â ll generally split about 50/50 between employer and employee (up to Ã¢Â Â¬250 employer contribution), no matter where you are.

    "content": "<html><head></head><body>Our revenue has increased more than 5x in the last year, and weÃ¢Â Â re scaling Heap to meet the demand. Our backend supports an expressive set of queries that need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. To make this possible, weÃ¢Â Â re working on a new distributed infrastructure.WeÃ¢Â Â re looking to bring on our first Infrastructure Engineer to lead the DevOps side of this challenge. Help us de-risk our stack, add more 9s to our availability, and incorporate open source tooling.__YouÃ¢Â Â ll own the design and development of our DevOps toolchain.__` YouÃ¢Â Â ll build a deploy pipeline and manage configurations. YouÃ¢Â Â ll set up performance metrics and act on them to scale a complex distributed system.WeÃ¢Â Â re looking for stronger software engineering skills than a typical DevOps role requires. YouÃ¢Â Â ll need to be able to understand our codebase and debug issues as they come up. Some example projects:* Select a service discovery tool and incorporate it into a codebase that assumes static locations for services.* Set up centralized logging and tools like Kibana for making use of the data.* Standardize our VPC configuration, which has a number of bad warts.* Set up Terraform or CloudFormation and use it to manage the complicated aspects of our AWS configuration.* Determine how weÃ¢Â Â ll monitor, backup, and otherwise operate our ZooKeeper cluster.* Much, much more.WeÃ¢Â Â d like to get to know you if:* __You communicate with clarity and precision.__ We care about this almost as much as your technical ability.* __YouÃ¢Â Â re self-directed with a strong sense for relative priority.__ There is low-hanging fruit everywhere. We need someone who has a good sense for which projects will have the most impact.* __You have experience with AWS__, especially EC2, VPC, and ELB.* __(Bonus) You have experience with our stack.__ Heap runs on Kafka, ZooKeeper, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Node.js.Heap has raised $13M in funding from NEA, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, SVAngel, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, Ram Shriram, and others.Our office is in San Francisco, but we have engineers around the world and are absolutely open to more remote engineers. We'd love to hear from you!</body></html>",
