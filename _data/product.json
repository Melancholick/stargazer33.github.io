There \nwould be less fear and violence and more love and creativity. If you agree with \nour philosophy, and you want to help us in our mission, then we may have the \nperfect job for you…\n\nThe Position – Content Manager\n\nTo promote our brand, we need to produce content that is educational, \nentertaining and original. The more articles, videos and graphics we produce, \nthe more visitors we bring to the site.\n\nAs Content Manager, you will start by creating most of the content yourself.\n\nThis is the fastest way to familiarize yourself with our learning philosophy \nand voice. After initial onboarding, expect to produce articles each week to \nstart. You will also test different marketing strategies while communicating \ndirectly with our audience through email and social media.\n\nSpeaking directly with readers and customers is the fastest way to develop \nyour marketing intuition.\n\nThen soon as you have a good feel for what works, you will help build our \n“content machine.”\n\nThis involves formalizing the processes for content research, production and \npublication. It also involves recruiting, training and managing other people to \noperate the machine.\n\nIn the long run, you will focus less on content creation and more on strategy \nand leadership.\n\nScope of Work (a day in the life)\n\n * Full Time position\n * “High-Touch,” calls multiple times per week\n * Manage blog content and guest post outreach\n * Produce/Edit 2-3 blog content per week\n * Doing research within the audience and tailoring content according to their \nneeds\n * Coordinate with writers, designers and other freelancers\n * Keeping up with the SEO industry at least on the surface\nCompensation and Career\n\nWe are looking for an Intrapreneurial-type person to grow with our company in \nthe long term.\n\nCurrently, we work as a distributed team. That means you can work from \nanywhere in the world on your own schedule. All that we require is that you are \nvery reachable and deliver results.\n\nDuring this 6-month trial period, we will pay you $2,000 per month. If the \ntrial goes well, we will negotiate a higher full-time salary based on your \nperformance.\n\nIn the long term, your salary will increase as the company expands. And if you \nprove yourself to be a rockstar, there is a potential for commissions and/or \nprofit share.\n\nLearning and Growth\n\nLearning and Growth are two of our core values at The Mimic Method. One way \nthat we live these values is by investing heavily in our own continued \neducation.\n\nIf we select you for this position, we will provide you with anything you need \nto make you a more effective Content Manager. This means professional training \nin highly useful skills like digital marketing, copywriting, and \npersonnel management, etc.\n\nThere is no better way for you to develop than to study the most effective \nstrategies out there and apply them to a real world setting.\n\nWe are looking for someone who values growth and learning above all else – and \nwe plan to nurture this value.\n\nMust-have Qualities\n\nFor this position, we are looking for someone with a specific set of \nqualities. Since we know these qualities to be rare, most people reading this \nwill NOT have them all.\n\nPlease do not apply for this job unless you have ALL the qualities described \nbelow.\n\n * Values-Aligned\n * Shrewd/Intellectual\n * Well-spoken/well-written\n * Highly-structured\n * Results-Driven\nAllow me to briefly touch upon each trait.\n\nValues-Aligned\n\nTo work with us long term, you need to share our core values of Truth, Growth, \nEducation and Respect.\n\nIf you strongly identify with the statements below, then you probably share \nour values:\n\n * I must constantly grow as a person, otherwise I am dying.\n * I have an insatiable appetite for knowledge, and I will continue learning \nfor the rest of my life.\n * My sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, nationality, etc, \ndoesn’t make me inherently superior to anyone, which is why I make a point to \nrespect everyone.\n * Before I die, I must travel the world and know its people as much as I can.\n * Before I die, I must create or contribute to something meaningful.\nDo you share these values? If so, keep reading!\n\nIntrospective/Shrewd\n\nAre you the introspective type? Do you spend way too much time contemplating \nthe nature of society, the cosmos, or the inner-workings of your own mind?\n\nI know I do.\n\nAs content manager, you and I will speak on a regular basis to develop content \nand strategy together.\n\nIf you are a fellow introspective, then our conversations will energize us \nboth. This energy will transfer to our work and enable us to reach our goals \nfaster.\n\nBut I don’t want someone who thinks like me. I’m a bit of a scatter-brain, so \nI need an unscattered brain to complement my thinking.  \n\n * Have you always had an intuitive understanding of people’s thoughts and \nemotions?\n * Do you often know what people are going to say before they say it?\n * Has someone ever told you “I feel like you know me better than I know \nmyself!”\nIf so, then you might be exactly the person I’m looking for.\n\nWell Spoken/Well Written\n\nMy preferred style of communication is live conversation. To refine my ideas, \nI need to stress-test them in debate. Are you able to formulate your views in \nthe moment and present them with clear argumentation? If so, then I’m looking \nforward to our first conversation!\n\nBut more important than that, I need someone with superb writing skills.\n\nYou need to take complex subjects and break them down into simple \nexplanations. Your writing must be clear but also enjoyable to read. Bonus \npoints if you can spice it up with some humor!\n\nYour writing ability will be the main thing that we’ll test you on during the \ninterview process.\n\nHighly Structured\n\nMost people love the idea of working on their own schedule, but few people are \nactually cut out for it.\n\nGetting things done on a consistent basis without a rigid external structure \nrequires discipline.\n\nFor this role, we need someone who’s always had that sort of discipline. The \ntype of person who likes to organize work schedules, computer files and sock \ndrawers for the fun of it.\n\nIf you’re the right person, then you know exactly what I’m talking about!\n\nResults Driven\n\nAs fun and interesting as all this language stuff may be, at the end of the \nday, we want results.\n\nAs content manager, your chief aim is to drive traffic to our site.\n\nWe we will assess your performance based on hard metrics like views and \nshares. So those of you who are numerophobic need not apply.\n\nWe are looking for someone with grit; someone who won’t stop working at \nsomething until she gets the results she’s looking for.\n\nNice-to-Have Qualities\n\nThe following qualities are not required for the application, but they are \nhelpful. If you have any of them, be sure to mention in your application video:\n\n * Can speak multiple languages\n * Has learned 1 or more foreign language to fluency as an adult\n * Is willing to spend extensive time in Lisbon, Portugal (company HQ)\n * Can play a musical instrument or can sing\n * Has extensive experience writing for other publications.\n * Has maintained a personal blog or vlog for extended period of time.\n * Knows how to write SEO-friendly articles\n * Has experience in online marketing (Content, Social Media, PPC, etc.)\n * Has experience managing personel.\n * Has experience in online business.\nApplication Process\n\nApply Here! <https://mimicmethod.typeform.com/to/vbjflO>\n\nThere will be 3 steps to this selection process:\n\n * Writing test and video application\n * Interview round 1 and Video Test\n * Interview round 2\nWriting Test and Video Application\n\nThe first step is to test your ability to translate my random thoughts into \nclear prose.\n\nIn the video below, I explain the importance of memorizing scripts for \nlanguage-learning. At the moment of recording, I improvised a metaphor about \nswimming that turned out much less clear than I hoped.\n\nWriting Test (Start video at 4:30)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5WOO-P6evis <https://youtu.be/5WOO-P6evis>\n\nYour job is to figure out what my point was (if I ever had one) and write it \nout clearly and convincingly in a blog post. You may use as few or as many \nwords as you deem necessary.\n\nThe main goal is to have a quality piece of content that captures the essence \nof what I was trying to communicate.\n\nVideo Application\n\nNext, you must record a video of yourself explaining two things:\n\n * Why do you want this position?\n * Why should we want you?\nThe video should be between 3-10 minutes in length and uploaded to a \nvideo-hosting service like vimeo or youtube.\n\nOnce your video and article are ready, fill out this application form \n<https://mimicmethod.typeform.com/to/vbjflO>. In the form, you will be able to \nattach your test article as a PDF and application video as a URL link.\n\nInterview Round 1 & Test\n\nIf I like your video and writing sample, I will contact you to set up a skype \ninterview.\n\nAt the end of this interview, I will explain a phonetic concept to you. Then \nit will be your job to create a short video explanation of that concept.\n\nThe goal here is to test your versatility as an educator and content creator.\n\nInterview Round 2\n\nIf you make it past the video test, we will have a final interview with you \nand the rest of the team. This is where we ask the tough questions to weed out \nthe final winner.\n\n—\n\nDoes this description fit you? Are you game for some unconventional \ninterviewing practices?\n\nDo you want to start a new location-independent career, build something epic, \ngrow professionally, and potentially get rich in the process?\n\nThen send us an application ASAP! <https://mimicmethod.typeform.com/to/vbjflO>",
